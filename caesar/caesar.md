caesar's last wish
==================

Flag: **twenty_three_stabs_are_way_too_many**

![caesar's last wish](images/caesar.png "caesar's last wish challenge introduction")

The challenge flavortext says "Caesar left a message for me. Can you
decrypt it?" and links to a text file containing a cipher:

> zh zrxog qhyhu pdnh lw wkdw hdvb.. rxu hqfubswlrq lv rqh vwhs dkhdg!livi mw er mrgvihmfpi xlsyklx sj geiwevr alex ai amwl, ai viehmpc fipmizi, erh alex ai syvwipziw xlmro, ai mqekmri sxlivw xlmro epws. ai amwl xli jpek mw jpek{xairxc_xlvii_wxefw_evi_aec_xss_qerc}

This appears to be a whitespace- and punctuation-preserving cipher,
and given the flavortext it probably involves a Caesar cipher.

After [running the cipher through a range of shifts](caesar.py "Caesar cipher
Python script") and inspecting the output, we find that the first half of the
cipher was produced by a right shift of 3, and the second half by a right shift
of 4:

The flag is thus `twenty_three_stabs_are_way_too_many`.
