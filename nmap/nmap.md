Flag: **hoist_the_anchor_we_leave_the_port**

![nmap](images/nmap.png "nmap challenge introduction")

The challenge flavortext says "Do you know nmap?".

Running `nmap` against the CTF host produces:

    $ nmap zeromutarts.de

    Starting Nmap 5.00 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2013-11-15 21:43 EST
    Interesting ports on zeromutarts.ikmfbs.ing.tu-bs.de (134.169.18.173):

    Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 10.62 seconds

The `echo` service running on port 7 is unusual; what happens if we connect to
that port?

    $ nc zeromutarts.de 7
    flag{hoist_the_anchor_we_leave_the_port}

The flag is thus `hoist_the_anchor_we_leave_the_port`.
