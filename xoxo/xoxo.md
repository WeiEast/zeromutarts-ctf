Flag: **meet_me_at_the_gates_at_midnight**

![xoxo](images/xoxo.png "xoxo challenge introduction")

The challenge flavortext says:

> My love,

> I am under constant observation from my parents, so I cannot speak clear.

> Here are two random images. You know what to do.

and links to two PNGs:

* [message1.png](images/xoxo-message1.png "message1.png")
* [message2.png](images/xoxo-message2.png "message2.png")

<img src="images/xoxo-message1.png" title="xoxo image 1" width="320">
<img src="images/xoxo-message2.png" title="xoxo image 2" width="320">

Given the title of the challenge, it seems like we should XOR or
otherwise diff these two images. Using the ImageMagick command line
utility `compare` to diff the images:

    compare xoxo-message1.png xoxo-message2.png -compose src diff.png

We get this resulting image diff:

![diff](images/xoxo-diff.png "xoxo image diff")

The flag is thus `meet_me_at_the_gates_at_midnight`.
